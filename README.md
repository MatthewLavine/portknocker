# Port Knocker

[![Go](https://github.com/MatthewLavine/portknocker/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MatthewLavine/portknocker/actions/workflows/go.yml)

Basic implementation of a port knocking server + client.

The server hosts port 8080 to an allowlist. A client must knock port 8081 to be added to the allowlist.
